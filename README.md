# Alarm Rock

Full-screen (1080p) clock display based on Electronm, making it a really heavy-weight alarm clock application.

My original idea was a full alarm clock with scheduling via Google's voice APIs, but never had much time to work on it. For now it fulfills a useful purpose as a 24x7, NTP synchronised, time display in my bedroom. It runs on an obscure piece of hardware I acquired which runs Linux and has a screen.

Run with something like:
```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start
```
