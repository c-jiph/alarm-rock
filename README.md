# Alarm Rock

Full-screen (1080p) clock display written using Electron. Or, a really heavy-weight alarm clock application.

My original intent was to make this a full alarm clock with scheduling via Google's voice APIs or something. I never had time to flesh this out though. For now it fulfills a useful purpose as a 24x7, NTP synchronised time display in my bedroom. It runs on an obscure piece of hardware I happened to acquire which runs Linux and has a screen.

Run with something like:
```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start
```
